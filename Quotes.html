    <p align="center">“What is the meaning of life? This meaning is not for you to find, but for <br>you to define. The meaning of life is found in the purposes that we <br>pursue as we grow older.”<br> ― Miriam Defensor Santiago, Stupid is Forevermore</p>

        <p align="center">“In my approaching old age, I am now supposed to share with you what <br>life has taught me, and in the end to encapsulate for you what is the <br>meaning of life. From where I am now, I find that these conundrums are <br>easily answered. First, life teaches us that, whether we perceive it as <br>predestined or as random, it is beyond any person's control. Second, <br>there is no template for the meaning of life. Instead, the meaning of life <br>is what you choose to make it mean. In making your choice, when you <br>reach my age, your journey becomes an affirmation of the warning that <br>life is a consequence of our moral choices.”

            <p align="center">“In my view, leadership is the courage to take risks in defense of a <br>position that is both legal and moral. The politician who tries to become <br>a wise guy by becoming friends to everybody - corrupt or not - is not <br> a leader.”

            <p align="center">“I have no illusions about myself, about my life, about leaving a legacy, <br>or making a mark in people's lives. We are so insignificant. We are only <br>here for a blink.”

            <p align="center">“I guess it's the expectation that something will happen - something <br>bright and shimmering, that has touched you life before, and will <br>descend on you again, when you turn a corner.”

            <p align="center">“In a corrupt country, if you want to succeed in politics, you must keep <br>your conscience under control.”

            <p align="center">“Before I formulate an opinion, I try as a scholar and as an academician <br>to read entire libraries on the topic and to listen to as many people as <br>possible, regardless of whether they are savants or plain fools. However, <br>once I have formed an opinion, I no longer want to change it. Only <br>experience can tell me whether I'm right or I'm wrong. If I'm right, I <br>will gloat a little bit about it. If I'm wrong, then I will excoriate myself, I <br>will apologize publicly.”

            <p align="center">“I sponsored and defended the Reproductive Health Law, although I am <br>a Catholic. In the Catholic church, a woman to avoid pregnancy is <br>allowed to resort to mathematics. Thank God, now Catholic women are <br>allowed to resort to physics and chemistry.”

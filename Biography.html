    <h3></h3> 
     <h4>Global <span>Fame</span></h4><br>
        <p>She earned the degree, Doctor of Juridical Science, in the United States. <br>Dr. Miriam Defensor Santiago is a globally famous personality, because of her legal brilliance and courageous example in fighting corruption. <br>In a nation where many public officials are charged with, or suspected, of plunder, her honesty shines like a light in the darkness.</p><br>
        <p>She has brought honor to the Philippines in several ways. <br>She is the first Filipino and the first Asian from a developing country, to be elected in the United Nations as judge of the International Criminal Court. <br>The ICC hears cases against heads of state. Thus, she put the Philippines on the global map in the 21st century. <br>Unfortunately, grave illness forced her to waive the privilege of being an ICC judge.</p><br>
        <p>For two years, she suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome. In June 2014 she was diagnosed with lung cancer, stage 4 (the last stage). <br>But with her signature humor and bravery, she fought back, and her cancer has regressed. Even cancer cells are afraid of her!</p><br>
        <p>She was chosen as laureate of the Magsaysay Award for Government Service, known as the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize. <br>She was cited “for bold and moral leadership in cleaning up a graft-ridden government agency.” <br>She was named one of “The 100 Most Powerful Women in the World” by The Australian magazine.</p><br>
     <h4>Academic <span>Excellenced</span></h4><br>
        <p>Dr. Santiago is one of the most intellectually brilliant leaders that our country has ever seen. <br>She earned the degrees Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude; and Bachelor of Laws, cum laude, from the University of the Philippines. <br>She went abroad and earned the graduate degrees of Master of Laws, and Doctor of Juridical Science, from the University of Michigan, <br>one of the top three law schools in the United States. She finished the academic requirements for the degree Master of Arts in Religious Studies, <br>at the Maryhill School of Theology.</p><br>
        <p>In U.P., the perfect grade is 1.0. In her last undergraduate semester, Dr. Santiago earned the near-perfect average grade of 1.1.<br>And she finished her 4-year course in only 3-1/2 years. At the University of Michigan, she was a Barbour Scholar and DeWitt Fellow. <br>She finished her master’s degree in only one year, and her doctorate in only six months.</p><br>
        <p>Our guest speaker loves learning. She has done postdoctoral studies all over the world, including Oxford University, Cambridge University, <br>Harvard University, University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, and Academy of Public International Law at the Peace Palace <br>(the seat of the International Court of Justice), at The Hague, Netherlands.</p><br>
        <p>Dr. Santiago was class valedictorian at all levels – elementary, high school, and college. She made history in U.P. when she became the first <br>female editor-in-chief of the famous student newspaper, Philippine Collegian, thus shattering a 50-year old record of male dominance. She <br>won as Best Debater in the annual U.P. law debate, where she was captain of the winning team. It is interesting that at the same time she held <br>a campus beauty title, not once but twice – as ROTC corps sponsor.</p><br>
     <h4> Professional <span>Excellence</span></h4><br>
        <p>Dr. Santiago holds an amazing record of excellence in all three branches of government – judicial, executive, and legislative. In the judicial branch, <br>she has been presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City. In the executive branch, she has been immigration commissioner; <br>and a cabinet member, as agrarian reform secretary. In the legislative branch, she has now been a senator for three terms.</p><br>
        <p>Dr. Santiago worked abroad. She served as legal officer of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. She <br>also served as a consultant of the Philippine embassy in Washington, D.C.</p><br>
        <p>In all three branches of government, she has been showered with awards for being outstanding, making her the most awarded public official in our country today. <br>For example, she has received awards such as The Outstanding Young Men, or TOYM; The Outstanding Women in the Nation’s Service, or TOWNS; <br>and Most Outstanding Alumna in Law from U.P.</p><br>
        <p>Dr. Santiago was a U.P. law professor for some 10 years, teaching evening class after office hours. She has written some 30 books, <br>many of which are very scholarly textbooks in law and the social sciences, well advanced of our time. During her initial battle with cancer, she <br>continued to work on the 2014 edition of all her law books. She is considered the leading expert of her generation in constitutional law and in international law.</p><br>
        <p>In the Philippine Senate where Dr. Santiago is on her third term, she has filed the highest number of bills, and authored some of the most important laws. <br>Some of her most important pending bills are: anti-dynasty bill; an act institutionalizing an age-appropriate curriculum to prevent the abduction, <br>exploitation, and sexual abuse of children; anti-epal bill; freedom of information bill; and magna carta for Philippine internet freedom. She has <br>been fearless in exposing and naming notorious criminal suspects in legislative investigations, particularly in naming jueteng lords and illegal logging lords.</p><br>
     <h4>Unquestioned <span>Honesty</span></h4><br>
        <p>It was Senator Santiago who in effect started the national plunder investigation (which is now a historic scandal). In December 2012 she <br>revealed that the senate president had used Senate funds to give away cash gifts. Every senator received P2 million as a Christmas gift, <br>taken from public funds, except Senator Santiago and two others. That scandal led to the notorious pork barrel scandal, for which the senate president <br>sis now suspended and in jail, having been charged with plunder by the Ombudsman.</p><br>
        <p>COA records show that her “pork barrel,” also known as PDAF, was never marred by any kickback, unlike those of her colleagues in Congress. In three <br>separate cases, the Supreme Court had upheld the pork barrel system as constitutional. Sen. Santiago gave her PDAF to: the University <br>of the Philippines system; Philippine General Hospital; and local government units. She never released her pork barrel to any NGO, particularly those <br>headed by those guilty of plunder, which means wholesale stealing of public money by accepting kickbacks, or simply pocketing the entire money.</p><br>
        <p>After the impeachment of the Chief Justice in 2012, it was later revealed that Miriam was one of only three senators who refused to receive the <br>DAP, amounting to ₱50 million for every senator and ₱10 million for every congressman. It was also later revealed that three senators <br>even received ₱100 million each, after the impeachment.When she was a student in U.P. law school, one magazine dubbed her “Supergirl at the State University.” <br>She is probably the public official whose face has graced the highest number of magazine covers. She has been featured by famous international publications, including Time, <br>the New York Times, and the Herald-Tribune.</p><br>

        <p>In 1992, the foreign press reported that she had been elected as President of the Philippines after a nationwide election. However, she was <br>cheated. As the Filipinos say: “Miriam won in the voting, but lost in the counting.”</p><br>
        <p>She is a renowned celebrity. Like a rock star, she attracts crowds everywhere. She is the most sought-after guest speaker of university students. <br>Sen. Santiago is a woman of destiny. She will be remembered in Philippine history as a genuine hero of her people.</p><br>
        <p>She has been called the incorruptible lady, the platinum lady, the tiger lady, the dragon lady, the iron lady of Asia, the queen of popularity polls, and<br> the undisputed campus hero. But to her millions of fans, she is best known for the unique brand of charismatic leadership that media likes to call “Miriam Magic.”</p><br>
